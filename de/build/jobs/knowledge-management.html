The OSB Alliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V. represents over 170 member companies in the Open Source economy, which together generate more than 1.7 billion € annually in Germany. Together with scientific institutions and user organisations, the association works to anchor the central importance of open source software and open standards for a digitally sovereign society in public awareness. The OSB Alliance sees open source and open standards as a compelling basis for digital sovereignty, flexibility and security in the digital transformation and thus as the answer to one of the greatest challenges of our time. With the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project, the OSB Alliance is contributing to the realisation of the goals of the German government’s Digital Strategy 2025 and the European Gaia-X project by developing a next-generation open cloud infrastructure. The project is driven by a small team in the OSB Alliance with multi-year funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team, there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in Europe who contribute to the project - some of them are funded by the project, others because their employers are interested in making this project successful. The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure, open-source software stack. It covers software-defined storage and networking, operations tooling for automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting, trending, identity and authorisation management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, as well as a Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows users (development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes cluster through standardised APIs and delivers standard building blocks that can be used to construct and manage container applications. This stack fulfills high security standards and comes with tooling and documentation that reduce the need for specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. SCS can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and can be deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed components from it. The resulting infrastructure can be subjected to a certification process that ensures strict compatibility with other SCS-based platforms, thus building a network of federatable, compatible clouds. The SCS project contributes to the European Gaia-X effort by serving as a reference for development work and enhancing it with an implementation that node-providers can leverage as a whole or in parts to deliver federated sovereign infrastructure, underpinning a sovereign data ecosystem. In this role, you will be part of the (fully remote) OSB Alliance team that leads and organizes the efforts to define, implement, validate (CI/CD), document and disseminate the SCS open source software stack orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that contribute to the effort interact closely with upstream communities and downstream providers create relationships, structure and technology to captience, including situations when operational issues happen design processes to encourage contributions to our knowledge base, collecting input also from people not involved in the SCS on a daily basis. structure the processes to document collected experience, validate it and make it available in ways that are easy to consume for cloud operators, developers and users. We expect that you have a good overview over open source system software technology have hands-on experience with structuring technical documentation and knowledge management systems know how to work with knowledgable individuals to efficiently collect and document information and experience from them have been in roles where you had responsibility for designing documentation or publications and ideally had leadership roles for teams that were tasked with such responsibilities have worked with open source communities with diverse background understand agile development methodologies are willing and able to present processes and technology We offer working in an open and inspiring environment, in a team of highly motivated experts, with top-level industry partners, relevant open source communities and scientists contributing to a project that will make a difference for Digital Sovereignty by being instrumental for a vivid ecosystem of federated infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond being a key part of a new project working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology a lot of flexibility in how you organise your work and contribute to the internationally distributed team.

funding from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). The
advertised position is part of this central team. In addition to this team,
there are numerous developers from different companies and institutions in
Europe who contribute to the project - some of them are funded by the project,
others because their employers are interested in making this project
successful.</p>

<p>The SCS project aims to define and implement a complete, modular, secure,
open-source software stack. It covers software-defined storage and networking,
operations tooling for automated deployment, logging, monitoring, alerting,
trending, identity and authorisation management, an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
layer, as well as a Container(Platform)-as-a-Service layer. It allows users
(development teams) to create and control their own kubernetes cluster through
standardised APIs and delivers standard building blocks that can be used to
construct and manage container applications. This stack fulfills high security
standards and comes with tooling and documentation that reduce the need for
specialised expertise to run complex cloud and container infrastructures. SCS
can be used by both cloud service providers and internal IT teams and can be
deployed as a whole or by just cherry-picking needed components from it. The
resulting infrastructure can be subjected to a certification process that
ensures strict compatibility with other SCS-based platforms, thus building a
network of federatable, compatible clouds.</p>

<p>The SCS project contributes to the European Gaia-X effort by serving as a
reference for development work and enhancing it with an implementation that
node-providers can leverage as a whole or in parts to deliver federated
sovereign infrastructure, underpinning a sovereign data ecosystem.</p>

<p>In this role, you will</p>

<ul>
  <li>be part of the (fully remote) OSB Alliance team that leads and organizes the
efforts to define, implement, validate (CI/CD), document and

  <li>orchestrate a cross-cultural and cross-company team of engineers that
contribute to the effort</li>
  <li>interact closely with upstream communities and downstream providers</li>
  <li>create relationships, structure and technology to captience, including
situations when operational issues happen</li>
  <li>design processes to encourage contributions to our knowledge base,
collecting input also from people not involved in the SCS on a daily
basis.</li>
  <li>structure the processes to document collected experience, validate it
and make it available in ways that are easy to consume for cloud
operators, developers and users.</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect that you</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a good overview over open source system software technology</li>

motivated experts, with top-level industry partners, relevant open
source communities and scientists</li>
  <li>contributing to a project that will make a difference for Digital
Sovereignty by being instrumental for a vivid ecosystem of federated
infrastructure providers in Europe and beyond</li>
  <li>being a key part of a new project</li>
  <li>working on cutting-edge open source infrastructure technology</li>
  <li>a lot of flexibility in how you organise your work and contribute to
